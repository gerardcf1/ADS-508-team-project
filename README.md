# AquaInsight – Water Conservation Forecasting

This project uses cloud-based tools and machine learning to analyze water usage trends across California. Our goal is to help public water suppliers improve drought preparedness and optimize conservation strategies.

## Project Goals
- Analyze water consumption across counties and climate zones
- Detect leading indicators of water shortages
- Forecast future potable water demand using machine learning
- Support smarter conservation decisions

## Data
- Source: California Open Data Portal  
- Dataset: Public Water System Monthly Operations & Water Production

## Tools Used
- Amazon SageMaker
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
